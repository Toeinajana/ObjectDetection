Language: Python.
Framework: TensorFlow.
Image dataset: CoCo API
Packages and libraries:  
- Protocol buffer
- Pillow
- Jupyter notebook
- Matplotlib
- lxml
- Cython
- CoCo API


This is how to set the project up.

## Getting Started


### 1. Install Tensorflow via pip ** if you don't have pip, you can install it 
```
sudo easy_install pip
```
and upgrade pip
```

brew install python3
```

### 3 Install Pillow, Jupyter notebook, Matplotlib, lxml and Cython
``` bash
npm install pillow
npm install jupyter
npm install matplotlib
npm install lxml
npm install Cython
```

### 4 Install Protocol buffer via Brew 
```
brew install protobuf
```
upgrade it to the lastest version
